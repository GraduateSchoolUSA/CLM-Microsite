		  <p class="para1">In this edition of the Newsletter we profile <span class="header1">adjunct faculty member, Diedre Windsor</span>. Diedre is a small business owner, retired U.S. Army Officer, former career member of the federal government’s Senior Executive Service, and Author of <span class="header1">Leadership Begins with Hello! Practical Principles of Leadership ~ A Hip-pocket Guide!</span> In her book Diedre shares practical leadership tips gleaned from 25+ years of supervisory and management experience. </p>
		  &nbsp;
		  <p class="para1">We asked Ms. Windsor to share a few nuggets from her book and this is what she had to say:</p>
		  &nbsp;
		  <p class="para1">You needn’t go further than the book’s introduction to get the gist of <span class="header1">Leadership Begins with Hello! Practical Principles of Leadership ~ A Hip-pocket Guide</span>. It’s not based on any specific or common leadership theory. It's written from a practical experience perspective and is based on 25 years of direct supervisory leadership experience. Twenty-fives years of sometimes getting it wrong and sometimes getting it right. Twenty-five years of observations of myself, my peer supervisors and leaders I’ve encountered. Leadership begins with Hello! talks to the most practical principles of leadership and offers repeatable behaviors we all have within our grasps that can be incorporated into our daily routines. </p>&nbsp;
		  <p class="para1">The book’s nine chapters cover everything from empowering others to making meaningful connections. <span class="header1">My personal favorite chapters are Chapter 1, "Understanding the Power in Hello"; Chapter 4, "Self-Awareness"; and, Chapter 9, "Trust is Earned."</span> Let me tell you why. </p>
		  &nbsp;
		  <p class="para1"><span class="header1">"Understanding the Power in Hello!"</span> illustrates how seemingly small gestures impact people and outcomes. It emphasizes how focusing on simple behaviors that tend to slip through the cracks make such a huge difference to people we encounter daily. While the chapter focuses on Understanding the Power in Hello, for good measure I’d add "Please" and "Thank you" to the list of behaviors that make a difference. </p>
		  &nbsp;
		  <p class="para1"><span class="header1">"Self-Awareness"</span> talks about the importance of understanding self. It’s easy for us to look around and point out what is wrong with everyone around us without considering how our own actions and attitudes affect those in our respective circles. Arguably, appropriate self-awareness is one of the most critical character traits to develop when it comes to interacting with the world as a whole. It’s very hard to motivate, inspire, and move others to action if you don’t understand the impact of our actions. Agree? <br />
		    <br />
		    <span class="header1">The chapter on "Trust"</span> talks to the very foundation of leadership. Many studies have shown, and most will agree, that trust is the most critical principle of leadership. Without trust, teams fail. Without trust there are limits to a leader’s ability to influence and therefore to lead. People don’t leave companies. People leave people. More specifically, bad leaders. If your people can’t trust you as a person, how can they trust you as their leader? Trust is the lynchpin holding it all together. Three key things to remember here: Trust, is earned, easy to break and hard to fix. </p>
		  &nbsp;
		  <p class="para1"><span class="header1">Leadership Begins with Hello!</span> is short and to the point, as it’s intended to serve as a guide and, in some cases, as a reminder about basic concepts that, if understood and used, can positively impact one’s leadership journey. </p>
		  <p class="header1">Happy Leading!</p>
